# codistirf
Codistirf detects diffraction limited object and measure the distance to the closest point of the membrane in multichannel imaging. Codistirf is based on a  library written by Francois Aguet [2].

* Multiple channel support (tested with four channels)
* GraphPrysm export
* Automatic diffraction limited object and membrane detection 
* GUI for membrane correction
* Robust to high-throughput microscopy (100Gb/s)


# Usage
See script  runFixedDualChannelAnalysis.m
